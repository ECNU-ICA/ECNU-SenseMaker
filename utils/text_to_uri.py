This Python module provides just the code from the 'conceptnet5' module that
you need to represent terms, possibly with multiple words, as ConceptNet URIs.
It depends on 'wordfreq', a Python 3 library, so it can tokenize multilingual
text consistently: https://pypi.org/project/wordfreq/
Example:
>>> standardized_uri('es', 'ayudar')
'/c/es/ayudar'
>>> standardized_uri('en', 'a test phrase')
'/c/en/test_phrase'
>>> standardized_uri('en', '24 hours')
'/c/en/##_hours'
